# Songwriting for Suno

Run `suno write` to scaffold the song; use this guide to fill and refine its output. `suno write --out song.txt` assembles the Style Prompt, the meta-tagged section skeleton, and the Suno Tags from the same grammar written up here, and prints the exact `suno generate` command — this document is the reference for what goes in the `<...>` slots and why, and for anything the scaffold does not cover.

This is the base grammar of writing for Suno: the structure, meta tags, syllable discipline, style formula, and vocal/hook vocabulary that produce a clean, generatable song. Every other guide (`suno guide priming`, and any genre- or effect-specific guide) assumes what is written here and extends it.

The song you write here is plain text that pastes straight into Suno or feeds the `suno` CLI. This document is markdown; the actual lyric/style output is not — see the output format below.

## Workflow

0. Run `suno write --genre <genre> --theme <theme> --out song.txt`. Steps 1-5 below are then a refinement pass over what it produced; write from scratch only if the scaffold does not fit.
1. Collect from the user: theme, genre, mood, vocal style. Supply sensible defaults for anything missing — do not block on questions.
2. Pick genre-specific tag combinations from the genre tables below.
3. Choose vocal direction, effects, and phrasing from the vocal styles section.
4. If the user wants catchy / viral / earworm / TikTok-ready, apply the viral hook techniques.
5. Write the lyrics using the output format below.
6. Generate audio with the `suno` CLI (see **Generate it** at the end).

## Output format

Plain text only. NEVER use markdown formatting in the song itself — no `**`, no `#`, no backticks. Each block below maps to its own Suno field (or CLI flag — see **Generate it**); only the lyric block between the `---` separators is ever pasted into a lyrics box or saved for `--lyrics-file`.

Every `<...>` span is an instruction to you, never lyric text — replace all of them. This is the same placeholder convention `suno write` scaffolds use, and the CLI's preflight refuses to generate while any `<...>` span survives, so an unfilled template cannot burn credits. (Do not invent other placeholder markers like curly braces: the guard only scans for `<...>`.)

## Rules

- **Plain text only** — no markdown, no commentary, no song notes in the output.
- **Lines**: 6-10 syllables, 4-6 words. Anything longer gets crushed or rushed by the model.
- **Tags**: Front-load structural/mood tags in the first 3-5 lines so the model locks the direction early.
- **Style formula**: 1-2 genres + 1 mood + 2-3 instruments max. Overloading the style prompt muddies the result.
- **Chorus**: Repeat it verbatim every time for consistency. Do not paraphrase across choruses.
- **Punctuation**: Commas = pause. Ellipses = breath. Hyphens = connected syllables. Line breaks = natural breathing points.
- **No real artist names** in Style Prompts or Suno Tags. Describe the sound qualities instead:
  - "Adele style" → "powerful female vocal, dramatic ballad, soulful belt, wide dynamic range"
  - "Billie Eilish" → "breathy whisper vocal, intimate, dark pop, minimalist"
  - You CAN mention genres, decades, film references, and technical vocal terms.

### Pronunciation & phrasing tricks

**Extending notes** — stretch the vowel to hold a note:

- `niiight` — holds the note longer
- `waaaaay` — sustained, dramatic

**Emphasizing consonants**:
- `runnn` — sustained ending
- `kissss` — hissing emphasis
- `stoppp` — hard ending

**Creating pauses**:
- Commas `,` for brief pauses
- Ellipses `...` for longer breath/pause
- Hyphens `-` for connected syllables
- Line breaks = natural breathing points

**Phrasing examples**

Smooth / connected:
```
Holding you close tonight
```

Broken / emotional:
```
Holding... you... close... tonight
```

Punchy / rhythmic:
```
Hold-ing, you, close, to-night
```

### Vocal tips

1. **Pick 2-3 descriptors max** — too many conflict.
2. **Match voice to genre** — raspy for rock, smooth for R&B.
3. **Vary throughout the song** — soft verse, powerful chorus.
4. **Use contrasts** — whisper before a belt for impact.
5. **Consider the lyrics** — emotional words need emotional delivery.

## Viral hooks

Apply these when the user wants catchy, viral, earworm, or TikTok-optimized songs.

### Earworm science

- 4 syllables max per hook phrase (brain chunking limit).
- 1.5-2 second phonological loop capacity.
- Repetition matters MORE than melody — repeat the hook 15-20+ times.
- 73.7% of earworms have lyrics (vs 7.7% instrumental) — put words on the hook.
- The hook must appear in the FIRST 7 SECONDS (streaming skip threshold).

### Optimal parameters

- 120-140 BPM is the sweet spot for earworms.
- Open vowels (oh, ah, ee, oo) are easier to sing and stick harder.
- Short hook: 3-5 words max for the core phrase.

### Psychological techniques

- **Zeigarnik Effect**: Incomplete phrases with "..." — the brain replays them to resolve the tension.
- **Dopamine architecture**: Quiet bridge → build → MAXIMUM chorus. Contrast = dopamine.
- **Call and response**: "You feel stuck?" (Stuck!) — creates participation and TikTok duet potential.
- **Na na na sections**: Universal singalong, no language barrier.
- **Pattern + surprise**: Predictable chorus, unexpected build/break.

### Suno-specific tags for catchiness

- Add "catchy hook" and "earworm" to the style prompt.
- Use a `[Catchy Hook]` tag before the chorus.
- CAPS on hook lines signals Suno to emphasize them.
- Add "gang vocals" for chorus power.
- Add "singalong" and "anthem" to the tags.
- Add "millennial whoop" for the oh-oh-oh pattern.

### Lyric techniques

- Rhyme schemes aid memory.
- Conversational language feels relatable.
- Unfinished phrases in the bridge create tension.
- Repeat the title/hook constantly.

## Generate it

Once the lyrics are written, produce audio with the `suno` CLI. Map the guide's output to flags:

- **Style Prompt line** → `--tags`
- **Lyric block** (the `[Verse]` / `[Chorus]` / meta-tagged text) → `--lyrics-file` (or `--lyrics "..."` inline)
- **Title** → `--title`

Save the lyric block to a plain `.txt` file (it stays plain text — no markdown), then:

```
suno generate \
  --title "Weekend Code" \
  --tags "indie rock, jangly and nostalgic, 110 BPM, warm male vocal, clean guitars, driving drums" \
  --lyrics-file lyrics.txt \
  --model v4.5-all \
  --wait --download ./
```

Use `--model v4.5-all` for cheap drafts (~10 credits/call — the cheapest model, ideal for iterating on structure and hooks). When the song is right, re-run on a stronger model. `--wait` polls until the render is done; `--download ./` pulls the MP3 into the current directory and embeds the lyrics into the file's metadata.

**Full `suno generate` flags** (v0.8.0):

```
--title <str>              Song title
--tags <str>               Style prompt / genre tags
--exclude <str>            Styles to steer away from
--lyrics <str>             Inline lyrics
--lyrics-file <path>       Lyrics from a file (conflicts with --lyrics)
--model <ver>             v6 | v6-wild | v6-mini | v5.5 | v5 | v4.5+ | v4.5 | v4.5-all | v4
--vocal <male|female>      Vocal gender
--duration <10-360>        Target length in seconds (v6 custom; omit for 180s)
--variety <0-4>            Creative range (v6 Custom, whole number)
--mumble                   Non-lexical vocals (v6; session-gated)
--max-mode                 Longer output (v6; account-gated)
--weirdness <0-100>        Experimentation / deviation
--style-influence <0-100>  How hard the tags steer the result
--audio-influence <0-100>  Weight of a reference audio input
--instrumental             No vocals
--persona <uuid>           Reuse a saved voice persona
--wait                     Block until the render finishes
--download <dir>           Download the finished MP3 (embeds lyrics)
--token <str>              Override the auth token
--no-captcha               Skip the captcha solve step
--force                    Bypass the duplicate-run guard and the placeholder preflight
```

**Cost**: v6 is plan-dependent (`suno credits`); v5.5 ≈ 70 credits/call; v4.5-all ≈ 10 credits/call (cheapest remaining legacy draft model). Downloading embeds the lyrics into the MP3.

### Quick alternatives

- `suno lyrics --prompt "..."` — a FREE lyric draft (no credits, no audio). Use it to spin up or refine a lyric block before generating.
- `suno describe --prompt "..."` — Suno writes the lyrics for you from a short description, then generates. Fastest path when you don't want to hand-write the song.
